# APT Name Generator

I was listening to Black Hills youtube channel and this was jokingly mentioned. I thought I'd give it a shot.

## Example Output

```
python3 aptnamegenerator.py
Your APT name is "Rotting Squid" -- congratulations! You're in the big leagues now!
```

```
python3 aptnamegenerator.py
Your APT name is "Toxic Irish WolfHound" -- congratulations! You're in the big leagues now!
```

```
